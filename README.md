# Google Analytics Dev Tools

This Dev Tools extension provides an easily-readable summary of Google Analytics events sent by the current page in the DevTools.
This extenstion makes it easy to see what timing, pageview and custom events are being sent to Google Analytics by directly inspecting the requests make to google-analytics.com by the current page. 

In addition to an easy-to-ready summary it also provides an expanded view for each event giving raw insight into what was sent to analytics. It also provides filtering options. 

It's an ideal tool if you need to develop analytics tracking to your application, ensure that the correct effects are being triggered and demoing existing analytics with others.

You can access the analytics console in the 'Analytics' pane in Google Chrome dev tools after installing the extension.
